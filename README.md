I am building a calculator with a UI as my last project in the
JS portion of the Odin Project's Web Dev 101 course.

I am only using vanilla JS and CSS for functionality and styling to make sure
I am comfortable with these languages and not relying on libraries.


for (i = 0; i < equationArray.length; i++)
{
  if(i = 0){
    equationArray[i] = a


    if(equationArray.length === 5)
    {
      a = operate(parseInt(equationArray[0]), parseInt(equationArray[2]), equationArray[1]);
      b = operate(a, parseInt(equationArray[4]), equationArray[3]);
    }
